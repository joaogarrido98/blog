I ended up falling in love with kotlin on my third year, when we had to create a big project that showed our programming capabilities and for 1 month I kept searching what to use and ended up using Kotlin with android to develop an app for vegan and vegetarian recipes, happy to say that app provided me with the highest grade possible! Now I'm just student trying to improve my knowledge of programming.",
